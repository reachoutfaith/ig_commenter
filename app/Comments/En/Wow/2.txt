I am speechless
I didn't even think of that
I couldn't be so I don't believe it
I don't believe my eyes. Or do I?
Surprised to look at this picture. 
Don't wanna say anything
I don't understand but it's catching my attention.

The composition of the shot can be an exellent example to follow.
So I can't describe my astonishment about it!
I thought it could be boring but no it's gripping!
colours and shapes are matching in the best way.
High level!
Just go on, man!
